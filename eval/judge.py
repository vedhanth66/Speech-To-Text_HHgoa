"""LLM-as-a-judge: the technique from the CampusX "LLM Eval Methods" video
this suite follows -- prompting an LLM to score another model's output
against a stated rubric, rather than exact/fuzzy string matching.

Two judge calls, matching that video's reference-based vs. reference-free
split exactly:

  judge_faithfulness()  -- REFERENCE-FREE. No ground-truth answer is given
                            to the judge at all -- only the retrieved
                            context and the generated answer. Scores
                            whether every claim in the answer is actually
                            supported by that context. This is the
                            hallucination check: a reference-free judge is
                            required here specifically because hallucination
                            is a property of the answer's relationship to
                            its *own* context, not to some external ground
                            truth -- an answer can be faithful to bad
                            context, or unfaithful even when the context
                            happens to be the same topic as a correct
                            reference answer.

  judge_correctness()   -- REFERENCE-BASED. Given the MSMARCO-XI ground-
                            truth answer (Eng_Answer) as the reference, and
                            the target system's generated answer, scores
                            whether they convey the same information. This
                            is what "correctness" means here -- e.g. is the
                            model right, not just non-hallucinatory (a
                            model can be faithful to its context and still
                            wrong, if the retrieved context itself doesn't
                            contain the correct answer).

Deliberately a *separate* call from whatever GENERATION_BACKEND produced
the answer under test (see eval/target.py) -- judging a model with itself,
using the same call that produced the answer, is a known bias risk (a
model is more likely to rate its own output favorably).

PROVIDER-AGNOSTIC ON PURPOSE: this suite is public, and whoever runs it
against their own RAG project won't necessarily have an OpenAI key --
they might have an Anthropic key instead, or a local-only setup with no
hosted API key at all. The judge picks whichever real, working credential
is actually present rather than assuming OpenAI:

  EVAL_JUDGE_PROVIDER=openai      force OpenAI (needs OPENAI_API_KEY)
  EVAL_JUDGE_PROVIDER=anthropic   force Anthropic (needs ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
                                   or any credential `ant auth status` reports --
                                   see the Anthropic SDK's own auth resolution)
  EVAL_JUDGE_PROVIDER=auto        (default) OPENAI_API_KEY if present, else
                                   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, else raise JudgeNotConfigured
                                   naming both env vars so the fix is obvious

Both providers are called with a strict JSON output contract (OpenAI:
`response_format={"type": "json_object"}`, verified working against
JUDGE_MODEL_OPENAI before use; Anthropic: `output_config.format` with an
explicit json_schema, which per Anthropic's own docs guarantees the first
content block is valid JSON matching the schema). The same tolerant
fallback parser backs both anyway, in case a provider ever returns
something unexpected -- fail closed (verdict=False) rather than crash the
whole run over one bad example.

No live Anthropic key was available in the environment this suite was
built and tested in -- the OpenAI path has been run end-to-end repeatedly
(see this repo's README for real output); the Anthropic path is written
directly from Anthropic's own current API documentation (verified
`output_config` schema shape, current exception classes), not guessed, but
has NOT been exercised against a live response here. If you're the first
to run it with an Anthropic key, and something's off, that's the part to
check first.
